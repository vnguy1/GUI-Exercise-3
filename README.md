# GUI-Exercise-3
[Level 3/4] Create a Java application that would act as the introduction to a game. There would be a starting screen with options (buttons) for instructions, play and quit. The instructions button would open another window with some simple instructions (it should have a back button to go back to the home page). The play button would open another window that would be a game (you do NOT actually have to create this “game”, just add a picture or something creative that could represent a game), but don’t forget a back button to the main menu (starting screen). And, obviously, the quit button will close all the windows to exit the program.
For an added challenge, actually create a small and simple game in that one game window, such as a guessing game (guess a number between 1-100). Where a person would enter a guess in a text box and click a button to check their guess. A label/text would pop up to say “Too high” or “Too low” or “You got it!”. Another game option would be a simulation of a dice rolling game where you click to roll and are trying to “beat” a computer’s roll. The game MUST be able to be played in that ONE window.
NOTE: The POINT of this particular exercise is to navigate among multiple windows, creating a simple working game in addition to that, would approach a level 4.
